One thing I noticed in my 30's is that if I want to learn something, I need to have other, separate goals to help drive that.  For example, I want to go to the gym in the mornings.  But I am NOT a morning person.  However there are days where I have to take my girlfriends kid to school, so I am a reluctant morning person on those days.  And since I'm up, I go to the gym.

I haven't had the desire to code in a while, so I asked a friend of mine to be my mentor while I try to shake off the rust.  The desire and motivation to code when not working however, has been tricky.  And when I say "tricky", I basically mean the desire is wildly inconsistent.  So I have this blog to help with that, as well as accomplish:

1. Writing down my thoughts.  I did have a journal in highschool (livejournal) and did use it a lot, despite it being pretty cringe.  It's gone now, but I'd like to think that I enjoyed the process of writing down my thoughts, instead of them just going to waste.

2. Track my progress.  Not entirely sure what I want to write here, but I was likely thinking part of it would be Blackjack related.  I took up card counting this year, and have enjoyed it a lot so far, despite me currently in a minor losing streak:
